Created thanks to the tutorials of Baeldung

https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-angular-web


## How to build
The frontend and backend are not a single build and must be started separatedly.

Developed using VS Code with the extensions "Spring Tools" and "Extension Pack for Java"

### Run Spring Boot
You need to install Java JDK 17
The root folder is a Spring Boot application so it's ran by pressing F5 from the VS Code

### Run Angular
The folder "Presentation" includes the source code for the Angular project. To run it, you need to install node

Then it's as easy as running "npm start" from the CMD.

To run tests you can run "npm test".

### Access application
After starting the Spring Boot app and the Angular client you can access it by the default Angular url http://localhost:4200
